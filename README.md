# 📊 Event Turnout Prediction Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that predicts and visualizes **event attendance** based on **weather forecasts** and **event metadata**.

Built using:
- **PostgreSQL** (data storage)
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (forecasting)
- **scikit-learn** (ML regression)
- **Streamlit + Altair** (visualization)

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates local events (e.g., outdoor concerts, farmers markets), fetches weather forecasts for them, and predicts expected turnout using a trained machine learning model.

It includes:
- 📦 Synthetic event + weather generation
- 🌦️ Integration with the OpenWeatherMap API
- 🧠 Random forest model to predict turnout
- 📈 Dashboard to explore predictions vs actual turnout
- 🎨 Color-coded event types for easy comparison
